Build a mobile app (Android + iOS) focused on agriculture for Indian farmers. The app must support two user roles: Owner and User. It should be simple, bilingual (English + Tamil), and include OTP-based login/registration (it need not get too deep and actually use otp authentication now) and AI-powered Tamil translation.
